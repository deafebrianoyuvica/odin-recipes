    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Indonesian satay, or "sate," is a beloved dish consisting of skewered and grilled meat served with a flavorful peanut sauce. This iconic street food is a staple of Indonesian cuisine, showcasing the country's rich culinary heritage. The meat, often chicken, beef, or lamb, is marinated in a blend of spices and coconut milk, giving it a tender texture and aromatic flavor.
        Satay is typically served with a side of rice cakes (ketupat), cucumber slices, and a drizzle of sweet soy sauce. The combination of smoky, savory, and nutty flavors makes Indonesian satay a favorite dish for gatherings, celebrations, or casual meals. Whether enjoyed at a bustling street vendor or prepared at home, satay captures the essence of Indonesia's vibrant food culture.
